# Traffic Light System with Dynamic Timing

## Problem Statement
Modern traffic intersections often suffer from inefficiencies due to static traffic light timings, leading to unnecessary congestion. The goal of this system is to create a **dynamic traffic light controller** that adapts based on the number of cars waiting at each road. The system should:

- Detect the number of incoming cars per second on each road.
- Allocate green light time dynamically based on traffic volume.
- Ensure fairness and efficiency in managing road congestion.

## Approach
This system simulates a **smart intersection** using an algorithm that:

1. Tracks the number of cars arriving at each road per second.
2. Determines which road has the highest traffic congestion.
3. Allocates a green light dynamically, with a minimum of 5 seconds and a maximum of 30 seconds.
4. Updates the system continuously as new cars arrive.

## Implementation
The system is implemented in **TypeScript**, using an `Intersect` class to manage roads and their traffic conditions.

### Key Components

#### 1. **Class `Intersect`**
- Manages intersections and their traffic data.
- Stores historical data for decision-making.
- Dynamically updates light timing based on traffic conditions.

#### 2. **Traffic Data Structure**
- `intersects`: An array representing each road's queue.
- `totalSumOfCars`: Stores the total number of cars per road.
- `lastIndexReserve`: Stores information about the last green light decision.

#### 3. **Decision Algorithm**
- Finds the road with the highest traffic.
- Allocates green light based on traffic throughput.
- Ensures fairness by not keeping any road waiting indefinitely.

### Code Summary
```typescript
class Intersect {
  readonly cars_throughput_rate: number;
  lastIndexReserve: { index: number; value: number; timeAllocated: number };
  numberOfIntersections: number;
  intersects: number[][];
  totalSumOfCars: number[];

  constructor(numberOfIntersections: number, cars_throughput_rate: number) {
    this.lastIndexReserve = { index: 0, value: 0, timeAllocated: 0 };
    this.cars_throughput_rate = cars_throughput_rate;
    this.numberOfIntersections = numberOfIntersections;
    this.intersects = Array.from({ length: numberOfIntersections }, () => []);
    this.totalSumOfCars = new Array(numberOfIntersections).fill(0);
  }

  addNewCars(newCarsPerSecond: number[]) {
    newCarsPerSecond.forEach((cars, index) => this.intersects[index].push(cars));
  }

  decisionAlgo(): number {
    const roadWithMostCars = Math.max(...this.totalSumOfCars);
    const indexOfRoadWithMostCars = this.totalSumOfCars.findIndex(
      (ele) => ele === roadWithMostCars
    );
    const timeAllocated = Math.max(5, Math.min(30, Math.floor(roadWithMostCars / this.cars_throughput_rate)));

    this.lastIndexReserve = {
      index: indexOfRoadWithMostCars,
      value: roadWithMostCars,
      timeAllocated: timeAllocated,
    };

    return timeAllocated;
  }
}
```

## Future Improvements
- **Integration with real-world sensors** to capture actual traffic data.
- **Machine learning optimization** to improve timing accuracy.
- **Multi-intersection coordination** for city-wide traffic management.

## Conclusion
This system provides a basic yet effective approach to dynamic traffic management. By leveraging real-time traffic data, it optimizes traffic flow and reduces congestion, making roads more efficient and safer. It can also use some changes.
